👋 Hi, I'm Greg, a software engineer skilled in building applications that merge functionality with high-quality design. With a strong foundation in front end, back end, and cloud technologies, I like to engineer solutions to complex problems from start to finish.

🚴 When I'm not coding, you can find me keeping physically active by hitting the gym 🏋️‍♂️ and riding my bike through the city, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen 🍳.

💡 I also try to stay ahead by keeping up with the latest in tech.
