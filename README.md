👋 Hey, I'm Greg. As a software engineer, I like to use my front end, back end, and cloud skills to create practical solutions to problems myself and others encounter in daily life. 

When I'm not writing code, I can be found keeping physically active by hitting the gym 🏋️‍♂️ and riding my bike through the city 🚴, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen 🍳. 

💡 I also try to stay ahead by keeping up with the latest in tech. I am currently working on a TypeScript API client for the Musixmatch API and learning how to make games with the Godot engine!
