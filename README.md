### Hi, I'm Greg! ðŸ‘‹

Endicott College '23 Computer Science student with a passion for problem-solving.

- :computer: I'm interested in full stack engineering and love to build cool and useful things.
- ðŸ”­ I recently completed my senior capstone project, a menu management tool for restaurants named 86it. I am excited to bring the skills and knowledge I learned from this experience to future projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving into Node.js to enhance my back end skills, and I'm always looking for new technologies to learn.
- ðŸš€ I'm actively looking for work opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue to grow as an engineer. Feel free to reach out to me at hoskinggregory@gmail.com if you're interested in collaboration or if you know of any opportunities!
