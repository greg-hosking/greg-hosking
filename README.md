### Hi, I'm Greg! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science 2023 Student at Endicott College with a passion for problem-solving.

- :computer: I'm particularly interested in full-stack development and enjoy finding innovative solutions to complex problems.
- ðŸ”­ I recently completed my senior capstone project, 86it, a menu management tool designed to enhance the dining experience. I am excited to bring the skills and knowledge I learned from this experience to future projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving into Node.js to enhance my back end skills, and I'm always looking for new technologies to learn.
- ðŸš€ I'm also in the process of starting a business from my senior capstone project as I continue to develop it further.
- ðŸ“« I'm actively looking for work opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue to learn. Feel free to reach out to me at hoskinggregory@gmail.com if you're interested in collaboration or if you know of any opportunities where my skills would be a good fit!
