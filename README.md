### Hi, I'm Greg! ðŸ‘‹

Endicott College '23 Computer Science student with a passion for problem-solving.

- :computer: I'm particularly interested in full-stack development, and enjoy finding innovative solutions to complex problems.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving into Node.js to enhance my back end skills, and I'm always looking for new technologies to learn.
- ðŸš€ I'm also in the process of starting a business from my senior capstone project as I continue to develop it further.
